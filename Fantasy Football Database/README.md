We created a database system that is designed to manage a fantasy sports league, allowing users to create teams, draft players, track performance, etc.

The primary objectives and goals of this database system are as follows:

- **Create their own fantasy leagues:** Users are able to create their own fantasy leagues and have other users join their leagues.
- **Create their own teams:** Users are allowed to create their own fantasy football teams with various players from around the NFL. Users can also choose which fantasy leagues they want to join by entering the `league_id` for their various teams that they may or may not make. In the future, we may want to implement a system where users can only join a league if they are invited.
- **Draft their own players:** Users can draft their favorite NFL players from around the league and gain a competitive advantage over their opponents.
- **Keep score and track the champion of each league:** This database system allows users to keep track of their fantasy football score against various opponents. Additionally, within each league, you can keep track of which team in that league won the championship. In the future, we may want to implement a feature that allows leagues to have multiple seasons without creating a new league as well as a way to record who won each fantasy football league for a given year.

If you want to run this project, one must create a sql file similar to the FantasyFootballWithValues file that I have attached to this repository.  From there, you can insert values into certain tables and create teams in various fantasy football leages.

One thing that I could do in the future would be adding a user interface and utilize full-stack development to create a fully functional fantasy football database with the recomendations implemented above.
