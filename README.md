### Introduction

I am a recent graduate from the University of St. Thomas with a dual major in **Computer Science** and **Data Science** with a minor in **Applied Statistics**.  Throughout my time at St. Thomas, I had the priviledge of taking many different thought provokoking technical classes such as Algorithms, Databases, Information Security, Data Structures, and much more. Furthermore, I joined the Computer Science Club which helped me develop certain skills necessary to succeed in any role related to software engineer/data engineer.  Therefore, as a result, many of my projects reflect the skills that I learned not only in the classroom but outside it as well, including Computer Science Club.  Primarily, I enjoy **Full-Stack Development**, **SQL** or **relational database** work, **Object Oriented Programming**, and any/all **statistical analyses** all of which I have extensive experience and practice with.  

This past spring semester, I worked on my professors own database management system, called **DBQA** which followed a **Model, View, Controller** design pattern in **IntelliJ** to build the project.  Similar to a job, we were asked either to add certain features or fix different bugs that were present within DBQA.  For example, for a one month period, I was tasked to implement set operators and nested queries within DBQA because it currently didn't have the technical power to do so. Currently, DBQA is in use by the University of Pittsburgh as they are using it to teach students how SQL works.  Therefore, this database managment system not only queries data from various databases, but does so in a helpful manner as it executes step-by-step in the order that the SQL is executed along with a step explanation explaining what's going on at each step.  As a result, I was able to experiment and learn both with the front end development and how HTML, CSS, and Javascript all interact with one another to create the UI as well as the back end development.  We used a Java Spring Web Framework for the back end which allowed us to build Java applications and integrate semalessly with various databases using Hibernate to query data.  Unfortunately, because this project was private and not owned by myself, I'm not allowed to share this project on GitHub.

### Other Projects

I have provided a deeper dive into each project within their correspoding folder.
-**TCO ACL Reconstruction Surgery**: Used 220 paired sample t-tests in order to find that ACLR + ML LET, a suregry to repair a torn ACL, restores the knee closest to the intact knee of any other ACL reconstruction surgery but tends to limit the mobility of the knee.
-**SMT Data Challenge**: Built an interactive dashboard using **RShiny** and **RStudio** intended for baserunners in all Major League Ball Clubs and their associated farm teams as a means to scout various pitchers and/or catcher tendencies when runners are on base in order to gain a competitive advantage on the basepaths. 
-**Fantasy Football Database**: Created a Fantasy Football Database system in VS Code that allows users to create leagues, teams, and add or draft players to every team.
