### Introduction

I am a recent graduate from the University of St. Thomas with a dual major in **Computer Science** and **Data Science**, along with a minor in **Applied Statistics**. During my academic journey, I completed a wide range of technically rigorous and thought-provoking courses, including Algorithms, Databases, Information Security, and Data Structures, among others. I was also an active member of the **Computer Science Club**, where I expanded my technical skill set through hands-on learning and collaboration.

My academic and extracurricular experiences have equipped me with strong practical skills in **full-stack development**, **SQL and relational databases**, **object-oriented programming**, and **statistical analysis**—all of which are reflected in the projects featured in this portfolio.

### Notable Experience

During my final semester, I contributed to a research-level database management system called **DBQA**, developed under the guidance of one of my professors. The project, structured using the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern in IntelliJ, simulated a professional development environment. Our responsibilities ranged from implementing new features to debugging complex issues.

One of my main contributions involved implementing **set operators** and **nested queries**—key functionalities that the system previously lacked. DBQA is now being used by the **University of Pittsburgh** to help teach students how SQL queries are executed. The system walks users through SQL queries step-by-step, providing explanations at each stage of execution to enhance conceptual understanding.

This experience gave me the opportunity to work on both frontend and backend development:

- On the frontend, I learned how **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** integrate to form a functional user interface.

- On the backend, I used the **Java Spring Web Framework**, allowing seamless integration with relational databases via **Hibernate**.

Due to the proprietary nature of the DBQA system, I am unable to share the project source code publicly on GitHub.

### Other Projects

Each project folder contains a more detailed overview of the work, tools used, and outcomes.
- **TCO ACL Reconstruction Surgery**
Performed 220 paired sample t-tests to evaluate the effectiveness of various ACL reconstruction methods. Found that ACLR + ML LET restores knee stability most closely to the intact knee but may reduce overall mobility.
- **SMT Data Challenge**
Designed and built an interactive **RShiny** dashboard for MLB and minor league baserunners. The tool helps scout opposing pitchers and catchers to identify tendencies with runners on base, providing a strategic edge.
- **Fantasy Football Database**
Developed a command-line fantasy football system using **VS Code** that allows users to create leagues, manage teams, and draft players. The system simulates real-world fantasy league operations with basic CRUD functionality.
- **Job Application Tracker**
Built a full-stack **Java Spring Boot** backend connected to a **MySQL** database, with a **React** frontend planned for future integration. The project provides a REST API for managing job applications (CRUD operations) with field validation, database persistence, and Postman-tested endpoints. Demonstrates backend development, database integration, API design, and full-stack project structuring.
